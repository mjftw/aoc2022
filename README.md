For a bit of fun I decided to solve the problems in as many different programming languages as I could this year.

So far we have:

| Day | Language | Style |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Elixir | Functional Programming |
| 2 | Rust, Python | Functional Programming, Imperative |
| 3 | Rust | Functional Programming |
| 4 | Scala | Functional Programming |
| 5 | Scala | Functional Programming |
| 6 | Clojure | Functional Programming |
| 7 | Bash | Linux command line foo |
